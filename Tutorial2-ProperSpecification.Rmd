This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.



## Non-nested Classes

```{r lmer2}
MLexamp.7 <- lmer(extro ~ open + agree + social + (1|school) + (1|class), data=lmm.data)
display(MLexamp.7)
```

## Nested group effects

And finally, we can fit nested group effect terms through the following syntax:

```{r lmer3}
MLexamp.8 <- lmer(extro ~ open + agree + social + (1|school/class), data=lmm.data)
display(MLexamp.8)


```

Here the `(1|school/class)` says that we want to fit a mixed effect term for varying 
intercepts `1|` by schools, and for classes that are nested within schools. 


```{r}
MLexamp2 <- update(MLexamp1, .~ . + (1|class)) # add a intercept for class
MLexamp2 <- lmer(extro ~ open + agree + social + (1|class) + (1|school), 
                 data = lmm.data)
exactRLRT(m = MLexamp1, mA=MLexamp2, 
          m0 = )
```

## Non-correlated random effects

```{r lmer4}
MLexampUnCor <- lmer(extro ~ open + agree + social + (1|school/class) + (0 + open|school/class), 
                     data = lmm.data)
MLexampCor <- lmer(extro ~ open + agree + social + (1+open|school/class),
                     data = lmm.data)

VarCorr(MLexampUnCor)
VarCorr(MLexampCor)
```
